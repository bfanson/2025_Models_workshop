If your R version is <4.0, it is a good time to update. R is the programming software that does the computations for your analyses. Using R is made much easier by using it through RStudio (_I_ntegrated _D_evelopment _E_nvironment).\r\nIf you are using a DEECA machine and and you do not have an open workstation then you may find it difficult to install R, RStudio and a range of R packages. It is recommended you have a workstation setting that allows you to download and install programs (like R and R packages). This is something you need to apply for through the DEECA IT service portal if you have not already. You should also have Rtools installed.\r\nTo install, the order of steps are as below:\r\nInstall R (> 4.0.0): https://cran.rstudio.com/\r\ninstall to ‚ÄòC:\\Windows\\program files‚Äô and accept all defaults\r\n\r\nDownload the version of Rtools matching your R installation: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/\r\ninstall to ‚ÄòC:\\Windows\\Data‚Äô and accept defaults\r\n\r\nInstall RStudio: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\r\ninstall to ‚ÄòC:\\Windows\\Data‚Äô and accept defaults\r\n\r\nOpen Rstudio as you would any other program to check that it opens.

During each day‚Äôs session, we will cover a new topic in the workflow pipeline.\r\nMonday: Overview of workflow, importing, cleaning (Ben)\r\nTuesday: Analysis of data (Paul)\r\nWednesday: Creating reports (Paul)\r\nThursday: Creating shiny Apps (Ben)\r\nWithin each day, the session is structured to be mainly ‚Äòtalk-and-chalk‚Äô for the first half and then more hands-on for the second half.\r\n** Notes **\r\nWe will not be offended if you just stay for the first half\r\nAsk questions anytime. Most likely someone else will have the same question. We may defer the question to hands-on section if it is too much of rabbit-hole.\r\nWe will have a wide range of skills across the days\r\nMost Importantly, tea will be provided!! üòÄ\r\nWhat the workshop is trying to do\r\nBecome familiar with data analyst workflow\r\nLearn a workflow from data cleaning to analysis to presenting/communicating results in one platform\r\nIncrease your knowledge about the R workflow, resources, and capabilities üëç\r\nProvide a resource to refer to to help remind you how to get going\r\nWhat is it NOT trying to do\r\nTurn you into a R programmer/Shiny app developer in 4 days\r\nGoing in-depth into any specific topic (except R workflow)\r\nMake you cry üò¢\r\nWhat to expect\r\nApproach\r\nCompared to when we started providing biometrics workshops, the amount of resources and online learning tools has exploded. Partly as a consequence, there has been a homogenization of workflow driven by key leaders in the area that have pushed the technology and analysis paradigms.\r\nGiven this, we will attempt in this workshop to act more as a guide to help you develop a solid framework that you can use as a launching point. We will point out amazing resources out but also hoping that the workshop will give you the foundation to dive deeper into the topics specific to your research/needs. Part of this is introducing to you to tools/concepts as well as introducing to the terminology in R workflows.\r\nMay need to take a step-back at times\r\nFor some, the last two days of the workshop might push their limits but the skills in these session are becoming more important as the expectation of how we communicate our research grows and evolves.\r\nOn Day 3 (creating reports), the Quarto(/Rmarkdown) approach takes a bit to get used to if you are used to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). The key is to focus on the higher level concepts (e.g.¬†focusing on the higher level concepts of how it could be useful for your research). Most importantly, once you have a template to work from and understand key fundamentals, you can easily modify (often having no clue how most of it works‚Ä¶my approach for years to be honest).\r\nNow, for Day 4 (Shiny Apps), Shiny is going to look, frustratingly, different as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\n\r\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\r\nui <- fluidPage(\r\n  fluidRow( \r\n    selectInput('x','X-Variable', choices = names(mtcars)),\r\n    selectInput('y','Y-Variable', choices = names(mtcars)),\r\n    plotOutput('plot') \r\n)\r\n)\r\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\r\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\r\n  output$plot <- renderPlot({\r\n    plot( mtcars[,input$x], mtcars[,input$y] )\r\n    \r\n  })\r\n}# Run the application \r\n\r\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, shiny apps have a very basic structure and once you get that (and a few other key bits), you can often grab other people‚Äôs code and modify slightly to get what you need.\r\nReminder - The goal here is not to make you a programmer but familiar with a few key tools so that you can tinker away.\r\nCourse Website\r\nObviously, there is a course website. For those that attended the masterclass on R spatial capabilities orchestrated by Justin Cally, the website design will be familiar. It is a blog-centric website and we will add each day‚Äôs lecture the morning of.\r\n\r\nWebsite is built using distill package and hosted by github pages\r\nBy the nature of this workshop, we have limited time and cannot go in-depth. Therefore, we have tried to distill out the key concepts/steps in the course notes, but there might be topics that need additional explanation and examples. If so, Paul and I are happy to write up a short-blurp about it and post it on the ‚ÄúExtra topics‚Äù in the upper right.\r\nPlug for QEARI\r\nJust a reminder QEARI (Quantitative Ecology ARI) is a great resource and a safe place for asking ‚Äúdumb‚Äù questions. The amount of expertise among its regulars is impressive! There are multiple channels to ask questions including a new one for shiny Apps!!!\r\n\r\nWhat to do when my brain hurts‚Ä¶\r\nZen out while checking out the 367 Collins Peregrines‚Ä¶.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These sites were spread across four Catchment Management Authorities (CMA) but with the majority of sites in the western CMAs. Sites were chosen partly to cover a wide variation in grazing intensity and grazing treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n  sf_site <- sf::read_sf('data/sf_site.gpkg') %>% select(-transect_id)\r\n  # sf_cma <- VicmapR::vicmap_query(layer='open-data-platform:cma100') %>% VicmapR::collect()\r\n  sf_cma <- sf::read_sf('data/sf_cma.gpkg')  \r\n  mapview::mapview(sf_cma, zcol='cmaname', layer.name='cma') + \r\n    mapview::mapview(sf_site, zcol='grazing', layer.name='site', col.regions=c('red','blue') )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonitoring\r\nIn each wetland, we are assessing how vegetation changes over time inside two trial plots. Each trial plot is about 0.25 ha in size. One plot is open to the grazing management being applied in the wetland and the other plot is fenced to exclude livestock (sheep and cattle). Monitoring is done when the wetland is drying out but still wet as this is the when most wetland plants are present. Monitoring is done along transects and quadrats in each plot before fencing, and then every year after fencing for 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nDesign variables\r\nSo, we have a hierarchical experimental design: site/plot/transect/quadrant. First we have the site-level. At this level, we have the grazing treatments: Crash (intense grazing, shorter) and Press (less intense, longer). Next, we have a paired design within a site with fence. Within plot we have transects and within transect, quadrats.\r\nAt the quadrat level, a large suite of responses were measured in this study. For the workshop we will focus on two response metrics measured at the quadrat level:\r\nNative species richness: total number of native species (summarised by transect-level)\r\nMaximum plant height: measured the tallest plant in the quadrat\r\n\r\nData provided\r\nOverview\r\nWe have three files:\r\nWorkshop 2024 data.xls - this is our main file\r\ndf_survey_info.csv - this contains survey info, such as date\r\ndf_quad_spp.csv - this includes extra quadrat-level about species present\r\nLet‚Äôs take a look at snapshot of each file\r\nWorkshop 2024 data.xls\r\nThis workbook has four tabs of data.\r\nsite_info tab\r\n\r\nspp_traits tab\r\n\r\nquad_ht tab\r\n\r\nspp_rich tab\r\n\r\ndf_survey_info.csv\r\n\r\ndf_quad_spp.csv\r\nNote - not used in day1 but may be integrated later\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
